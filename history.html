      <h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FLORENCE, ITALY</h1>
      <p>
        The great city of Florence was founded by the Romans in 59 BC. It was a
        colonia, a settlement for retired soldiers and it was called Florentia.
        The new town flourished and grew under Roman rule. However, in the 4th
        century, the Roman Empire split into two, East and West. In the 5th
        century, Germanic peoples overthrew the Western Roman Empire. The
        Eastern Roman Empire survived as the Byzantine Empire. In the 6th
        century, the Byzantine Emperor attempted to reconquer Italy and there
        was a struggle between the Byzantines and a Germanic people called the
        Goths. During the fighting, Florence changed hands several times.
        However late in the 6th century, a people called the Lombards captured
        Florence and there was a long period of peace. Then in 774, Charlemagne
        captured Florence.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the 11th century Florence was once again a flourishing town and in
        1115 the Count of Tuscany made it self governing commune. Florence
        became a large and rich city and in 1252 a gold coin called the florin
        was minted. However, in 1348 Florence was devastated by the Black Death.
        Yet the city soon recovered and in the 15th century, it became a center
        of the arts. Meanwhile, from 1434 until 1737 the Medicis were the
        leading family in Florence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1494 Florence surrendered to a French army. Then in 1527, it was
        captured by an army from the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. However,
        Florence continued to flourish although in 1737 the rule of the Medicis
        came to an end. Afterward, Tuscany, including Florence came under
        Austrian rule.

      <p>
        In 1820 the famous nurse
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale"
          >Florence Nightingale
        </a>
        was born in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1861 Tuscany became part of the newly united kingdom of Italy. In
        1865 it became the capital but in 1871 it was replaced by Rome. During
        the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the population of
        Florence rose rapidly and the city prospered. However, during the Second
        World War Florence was occupied by Germans in the period 1943-1944. When
        they retreated the Germans destroyed the bridges in Florence except for
        the Ponte Vecchio. Yet after the war, Florence soon recovered. However,
        on 4 November 1966 Florence suffered a severe flood. The River Arno
        burst its banks and at least 35 people were killed. Once again Florence
        recovered. In 1982 UNESCO declared Florence a World Heritage Site. Today
        Florence is flourishing. Many tourists are drawn to the city by its art
        and architecture. Today the population of Florence is 374,000.
